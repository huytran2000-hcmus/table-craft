# Design system

Every colour, spacing step, radius and font in the renderer is a token, written as a CSS variable
by `renderer/appearance/apply.ts` from the active theme, font settings and density (decision 012).
Components reference tokens, never literals.

_To be filled in when the appearance layer lands: the token list, which token each surface uses,
density values, and the contrast pairs the theme test asserts._
